# Exercises

Keep these incremental—students should be able to complete each in ~10–20 minutes.

1. **Add a new agent type**
   - Example: `Courier` that prefers visiting `Place(kind="shop")`

2. **Add a new place kind**
   - Example: `Hospital` and a rule that sends agents there when `health < threshold`

3. **Add a sensor/metric**
   - Track average distance traveled per step

4. **Add congestion**
   - Movement cost increases when a cell contains many agents

5. **Add a schedule**
   - Agents commute: home → work → home
