# Simulated City (Workshop Template)

This template is for a workshop where students learn **agent-based programming in Python** by building pieces of a simple "simulated city"—a lightweight starting point for an **urban digital twin**.

The goal is to keep the code:
- Small enough to read in one sitting
- Modular enough to extend (agents, places, sensors, movement rules)
- Practical for notebook-driven exploration

Core ideas
- **Agents**: autonomous entities (people, vehicles, service workers)
- **Places**: homes, workplaces, stations, intersections
- **Environment**: a grid-based city (easy to visualize and modify)
- **Dynamics**: step-based simulation with simple rules

Repo overview
- `src/simulated_city/`: the library students import
- `notebooks/`: workshop notebooks
- `docs/`: workshop handouts and exercises
- `tests/`: small sanity checks
